Directly clone the project. The customeTreeGrid component is a stand-alone component. Take a look at the sampleData.json, the component required a fixed property of json to work on. Feel free to update the json at your end.

In this component, we can select and de-select the parent and children respectively not being hampered by expand and collapse rows. Also it contains the disabled checkbox feature for the rows, if required. At last, it has a unique feature which can show that if there is no child for a parent. It is trial project so it contains the hierarchy upto 1 level only.
